### EPFL CS-433 - Project 1

This is our project submission for the autumn 2017 CS-433 class. It creates a `results.csv` file when running `run.py` within any Anaconda environment, from inside the `scripts` folder, provided a training dataset `train.csv` and a testing dataset `test.csv` are provided in the `data` folder.

We implement in `scripts/implementations` helpers for multiple types of regressions, such as `ridge_regression` and `logistic_regression`, along with multiple additional functions such as methods for getting the best parameters for a given regression.

To reproduce the dataset of our submission, just run `python run.py` from inside the `scripts` folder.
