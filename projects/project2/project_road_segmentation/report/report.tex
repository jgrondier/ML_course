\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
\todo{kill me pls}

\subsection{Feature processing}
Wee tried adding house labels, but didn't help

\section{Models applied}

\subsection{Logistic regression}
We tried to do logreg but was shit.

\subsection{Convolutional Neural Network}
Started off by using the given tensorflow network



\section{Results post-processing}
Fill holes.

use canny+Hough to find major axis, rotate a cross-shaped kernel to align it, then convolve
